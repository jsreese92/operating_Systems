why do I have to use ./test but can just say 530shell to run it?
    --because there's already test defined in my path elsewhere

I think a text file ends with a newline regardless, which causes
a new prompt to come up, and it also contains an EOF character.
    so when a file ends, ONE extra prompt comes up.

Or rather, the total number of times the prompt comes up, comes up
AFTER ls or pwd is done executing.
